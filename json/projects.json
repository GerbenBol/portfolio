        "intro" : "One of the larger projects I've done, DeLorean Dash is a racing game. It is a gravity-defying synthwave-inspired racer, in which you race against your previous best record. With a group consisting of 3 developers and 3 artists, we had to communicate a lot, and work with GIT correctly.",
        "desc" : "How do you make a racing game fun? This was the question we were facing when we started working on what would become 'DeLorean Dash'. We ended up thinking of an idea where the player would have no real sense of what was up and what was down. The car would be able to drive on walls and ceilings, effectively making everything a floor.<br>We also came up with a gravity flip system where the car would have to flip to stay on the track. Players can race against the ghost of their personal best, and keep getting better.",
        "mywork" : [
            "<strong>Personal Best</strong><br>I made a system that stores the best time driven locally, and when it got through all of the checkpoints. It automatically compares the driven time to the previous best, and stores this, given it is faster than the previous.",
            "<strong>Ghost</strong><br>This system was something I coded, but it was incredibly impractical. It stores the location of the car very often, and the same thing could be achieved in a much more efficient way. It still worked, and shows a ghost of your personal best.",
            "<strong>UI & Menu's</strong><br>I also worked on the UI and menu's. I gave players the option to change their controls, but unfortunately I didn't have enough time to also include sound settings and video settings (e.g. frame rate). Another thing I did was a bit of the UI for when the player is on the track, such as triggers when a gravity switch was coming up, which button to press.",
            "<strong>Camera Movement</strong><br>Though the camera movement was mostly done by someone else, I did contribute a little bit towards the end of the project. A couple of us thought the car didn't feel fast enough, and sometimes the camera would phase through the ground, leading to the player not being able to see where they're driving. I fixed this by tweaking the camera settings.",
            "<strong>Checkpoints</strong><br>I made a system of checkpoints and of course, a finish line. The player would have to drive 3 laps, which ended up being longer than expected (7.5 minutes was the fastest time driven by us). A lap would not be counted if the player had not gone through all checkpoints, so driving back and forth through the finish line wouldn't work. The checkpoints were also used in cases where the player would fall off the track, respawning would set them back at the last checkpoint they went through."

It was about a week's worth of work, which was at school and at home as well. It's now on a virtual machine at my home, however the machine resets itself a lot and I don't bother checking on it enough.<br>The bot contains 5 functions: 'add-quote', 'get-quote', 'all-quotes', 'update-quote' and 'delete-quote'. Most of them do exactly as they sound, but 'get-quote' has some specific parameters that can define how the bot searches. It can be used with 0 parameters, which will return a random quote. It can be used with an id as parameter, which will return the quote with the given id. It can also be used with a query as parameter, which will return a random quote which contains the query.",
