With a group consisting of 3 developers and 3 artists, we had to communicate a lot, and work with GIT correctly.",
        "desc" : "How do you make a racing game fun? This was the question we were facing when we started working on what would become 'DeLorean Dash'. We ended up thinking of an idea where the player would have no real sense of what was up and what was down. The car would be able to drive on walls and ceilings, effectively making everything a floor.<br>We also came up with a gravity flip system where the car would have to flip to stay on the track. Players can race against their own ghost of their personal best, and keep getting better.",

Something that was also not done was my original plan of a randomized labyrinth at the start of the level, as it was too much work. Overall it was a pretty nice project, which I enjoyed.",
